This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Setup Instructions:

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.

2. Create a .env file and inside of that file make `REACT_APP_API_KEY = your API key`.

3. Run `yarn start` and go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

I'll probably deploy this to Heroku as well.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
